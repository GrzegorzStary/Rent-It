### Real User Experience Testing. 

To complete real-world testing, I shared my website with a few older people who have basic computer experience.

I also asked one of my guests to review the website for me.

There was also one user experience story at the very beginning of testing.

The story went as follows:
My original idea for the main button in the center of the carousel was to redirect potential guests to the booking section as quickly as possible. So, the button was labeled BOOK NOW!

Later on, a person who was exploring the website told my wife that they would prefer to first see the rooms we have available. That would provide a better experience for them.

This is why I changed the BOOK NOW button to OUR ROOMS!
Now, the user is redirected to the available rooms section, where they can view the options and book the one they like.

I thought this was a good idea, so I made the changes on the website accordingly.

Below is the evidence of the user experience feedback, as well as my wife's confirmation that the website has been updated accordingly.

The last person who tested my website was my classmate David. Please see below for some screenshots of the website, along with his feedback.

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse tool to check for issues.

## WAVE EVALUATION

I tested my deployed project using the WAVE evaluation tool to assess accessibility.

All pages flagged a contrast issue related to the orange button with white text. While this does not meet standard contrast requirements, the button contains large text and is prominently sized. As it aligns with our established design patterns, we have decided to retain this styling.

### BUGS

Throughout the development process, I encountered numerous bugs in my code. While it would be difficult to detail all of them here, I will highlight a few notable examples.

- Reservation Form Validation: Prevented users from selecting a check-in date in the past or a check-out date earlier than the check-in.

- Tab Title Formatting: Standardized tab title structure across all pages by adding a missing " - " (dash and space).
About Page Layout: Corrected a custom CSS class error that caused the button to stick to the footer.

- Form Layout: Fixed a typo that caused the submit button to align left instead of remaining centered.
Responsive Navigation: Repaired a broken Bootstrap link that prevented the hamburger menu from functioning on smaller screens.

- My Booking View Layout: Fixed layout issues for small screens to ensure proper responsiveness.

- 404 Page Display: Resolved an issue that prevented the custom 404 page from displaying correctly.

- Review Template Image: Corrected the image source reference to use the appropriate variable in the review template.

  THERE ARE NO OTHER BUGS I AM AWARE OF
