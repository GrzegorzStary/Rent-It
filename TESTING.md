## HTML Validation

I used the [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate my HTML files.

#### Template syntax:
- Some of the reported errors (“Bad value {% url ... %} for attribute href” or “Stray doctype”) are not actual code issues. They occur because the validator processes the raw Django template files, which include template tags such as {% load static %} or {% url '...' %}. These tags are not part of standard HTML, so the validator flags them as invalid. Once the templates are rendered by Django, they produce valid HTML output, and those errors disappear.

#### Stray elements:
- During validation I did notice one genuine issue - a stray <div> tag - which has now been corrected. After fixing this, no further structural issues were found in the rendered pages.

#### Warnings:
- Some additional warnings remain (such as the recommendation to add lang attributes or metadata improvements). These do not affect functionality but are good practice for accessibility and SEO.
Why the validator complains about Django
The W3C validator expects plain, static HTML. Django templates, however, contain server-side directives ({% ... %} and {{ ... }}) which are only resolved at runtime. To the validator, these look like “illegal characters” or “unknown tags.” For accurate validation, the check must be run on the rendered HTML (the source as delivered by the browser), not on the raw template files.

## CSS

I used the [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate my CSS files.

## JavaScript

I have used the [JS LINT](https://www.jslint.com/) to validate my JavaScript files.

### JavaScript - Linting (JSLint)
When running my files through JSLint, a few warnings appeared across files:

- “Expected '{' and instead saw 'return'”
Cause: I use single-line return statements (if (!errorDiv) return;).
Explanation: This is valid ES6 syntax but JSLint prefers full block statements ({}).
- “Expected ';' and instead saw ','”
Cause: I declare multiple variables in one line (let stripePublicKey, clientSecret;).
- Explanation: Valid in ES6+, but JSLint enforces one declaration per line.
“Unexpected ': style'”
- Cause: I pass an object property { style: style } to Stripe Elements.
Explanation: This is correct ES6 object property syntax, but JSLint sometimes flags it.

### Why I kept the code as it is? 
- These warnings are stylistic only, not runtime errors.
- The code executes correctly in all modern browsers.
- They appear because JSLint has stricter/older style rules and limited ES6+ support.

### Rent-It

- I did not make any changes to settings.py because the warnings are only style related (long lines, whitespace, inline comment spacing) and do not affect functionality. Since this file controls critical project configuration (database, AWS, Stripe, etc.), modifying it only for PEP8 compliance could introduce unnecessary risks. It is safer to keep the file as it is, since it already works correctly in development and production.

## Browser Compatability

I have tested my site on different browsers to check for any compatability issues.

#### Firefox & Tor Browser Display Issues

- During testing, the site initially failed to load styles and scripts in Firefox and Tor. This was caused by incorrect Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes on Bootstrap and Font Awesome CDN links, which Firefox strictly enforces, and by blocked telemetry requests from Stripe.

- Fix: Removed or replaced the broken integrity attributes with correct values, ensuring all resources load over HTTPS. Stripe telemetry errors were confirmed as non critical (payments still work) and documented. After these adjustments, the site displays consistently across Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Tor.

### Real User Experience Testing. 

Real World Testing - Older User
-To complete real world testing, I shared the website with an older user who has only basic computer experience. Their assigned task was to:

- Create a new account
- Update their profile details
- Find a product to rent
- Proceed through the rental flow up to checkout
- Complete the payment step using a dummy card

### EXTRA – User Did Not Understand English

### Second Tester

The second person who tested the website was my wife. I gave her a simple end-to-end task to verify the core rental flow:

- Find a product
- Select rental dates
- Confirm that the calculated price was correct
- Navigate to the checkout page
- Complete the payment process

- Next Task - Profile & Rentals

The next task for my wife was to log into her profile and test the user account features:

- Access the profile dashboard
- Manage her own product listing visibility (toggle between visible/hidden)
- Check her active rentals
- Verify the rental details, including the location where she would need to go to pick up the item.

## Lighthouse

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse tool to check for issues.

- During testing with performance and best practice auditing tools the overall Best Practice score was slightly reduced across all pages. 
This is caused by third-party cookies automatically injected by Stripe.
These cookies are essential for secure payment functionality and are beyond the control of the application. 
No action is required on the project side, and this behaviour is expected when integrating Stripe.

- The performance score was slightly reduced across several pages due to the use of large image files (particularly product images). While these images display correctly and maintain good visual quality, they increase page load times and impact Lighthouse performance results.

| Page | Size | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/LIGHTHOUSE/home.png) | Lower performance due to large images |

## WAVE EVALUATION

I tested my deployed project using the WAVE evaluation tool to assess accessibility.

- Accessibility testing flagged minor contrast issues in the footer links (FAQ, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service). 
While these links technically fall below the recommended WCAG contrast ratio, they remain legible due to the surrounding design, consistent font size, and clear spacing. As this colour scheme aligns with the established Rent-It branding, the decision was made to retain this styling.

#### On the positive side, Rent-It places a strong emphasis on inclusivity:

- The site is massively ARIA-labelled, ensuring screen readers can interpret and announce elements correctly.
Key interactive components (buttons, forms, navigation) have aria-labels and role attributes for improved accessibility.

#### This means that even users with disabilities can successfully navigate and benefit from the platform - from browsing items to listing items and completing the checkout flow, potentially improving their living standard due to extra income stream.

### Notable Bugs and Problems Encountered

Throughout the development of Rent-It, a wide range of bugs were identified and fixed. While it is impossible to list them all, the most interesting and challenging ones included:

- **Stripe Card Element Not Rendering:**  
  At one stage the Stripe card input failed to load, showing `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`. This was traced to a browser/network issue blocking Stripe’s CDN. Switching script sources and cleaning up the Stripe integration resolved it.

- **Session Data & Checkout Totals:**  
  Checkout initially only displayed one item with incorrect totals. The issue was caused by how session data was populated in the reservation views. Adjustments were made to ensure multiple items and deposits calculated correctly.

- **Image Carousel Bugs:**  
  Product image carousels sometimes displayed incorrectly (only working on mobile but not on desktop, or Safari scaling problems). Fixes included unique carousel IDs per item and refined CSS (object-fit, aspect-ratio) to ensure consistent display.

- **Template Context Errors:**  
  Emails to item owners originally failed with `VariableDoesNotExist` because the template expected `item.product` while only `product` was passed in context. Updating templates to use the correct variables fixed the issue.

- **Profile Validation Gaps:**  
  Profile editing allowed blank required fields (like last name). Additional validation was added to enforce proper data integrity.

- **OAuth Social Login:**  
  While GitHub logins worked, Google login returned errors due to a misconfigured redirect URI. This highlighted the importance of correct OAuth setup across providers.

- **Static & Media on AWS:**  
  Setting up AWS S3 and linking with Heroku caused multiple issues with permissions and missing files. Correct bucket configuration (ACLs, policies, static/media separation) resolved this.

- **Accessibility and Contrast Warnings:**  
  Automated audits flagged low-contrast footer links and missing ARIA labels. While some design choices were kept for branding, ARIA labeling was improved to make the site screen reader friendly.

These challenges helped shape Rent-It into a more stable and user friendly application. 
Each bug provided valuable learning, particularly around 
**session handling, third-party integrations (Stripe, AWS, OAuth), and accessibility best practices**.
