## HTML Validation

I used the [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate my HTML files.

#### Template syntax:
- Some of the reported errors (e.g., “Bad value {% url ... %} for attribute href” or “Stray doctype”) are not actual code issues. They occur because the validator processes the raw Django template files, which include template tags such as {% load static %} or {% url '...' %}. These tags are not part of standard HTML, so the validator flags them as invalid. Once the templates are rendered by Django, they produce valid HTML output, and those errors disappear.

#### Stray elements:
- During validation I did notice one genuine issue - a stray <div> tag - which has now been corrected. After fixing this, no further structural issues were found in the rendered pages.

#### Warnings:
- Some additional warnings remain (such as the recommendation to add lang attributes or metadata improvements). These do not affect functionality but are good practice for accessibility and SEO.
Why the validator complains about Django
The W3C validator expects plain, static HTML. Django templates, however, contain server-side directives ({% ... %} and {{ ... }}) which are only resolved at runtime. To the validator, these look like “illegal characters” or “unknown tags.” For accurate validation, the check must be run on the rendered HTML (the source as delivered by the browser), not on the raw template files.

## CSS

I used the [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate my CSS files.

## JavaScript

I have used the [JS LINT](https://www.jslint.com/) to validate my JavaScript files.

### JavaScript - Linting (JSLint)
When running my files through JSLint, a few warnings appeared across files:

- “Expected '{' and instead saw 'return'”
Cause: I use single-line return statements (e.g. if (!errorDiv) return;).
Explanation: This is valid ES6 syntax but JSLint prefers full block statements ({}).
- “Expected ';' and instead saw ','”
Cause: I declare multiple variables in one line (e.g. let stripePublicKey, clientSecret;).
- Explanation: Valid in ES6+, but JSLint enforces one declaration per line.
“Unexpected ': style'”
- Cause: I pass an object property { style: style } to Stripe Elements.
Explanation: This is correct ES6 object property syntax, but JSLint sometimes flags it.

### Why I kept the code as it is? 
- These warnings are stylistic only, not runtime errors.
- The code executes correctly in all modern browsers.
- They appear because JSLint has stricter/older style rules and limited ES6+ support.

### Real User Experience Testing. 

To complete real-world testing, I shared my website with a few older people who have basic computer experience.

I also asked one of my guests to review the website for me.

There was also one user experience story at the very beginning of testing.

The story went as follows:
My original idea for the main button in the center of the carousel was to redirect potential guests to the booking section as quickly as possible. So, the button was labeled BOOK NOW!

Later on, a person who was exploring the website told my wife that they would prefer to first see the rooms we have available. That would provide a better experience for them.

This is why I changed the BOOK NOW button to OUR ROOMS!
Now, the user is redirected to the available rooms section, where they can view the options and book the one they like.

I thought this was a good idea, so I made the changes on the website accordingly.

Below is the evidence of the user experience feedback, as well as my wife's confirmation that the website has been updated accordingly.

The last person who tested my website was my classmate David. Please see below for some screenshots of the website, along with his feedback.

## WAVE EVALUATION

I tested my deployed project using the WAVE evaluation tool to assess accessibility.

All pages flagged a contrast issue related to the orange button with white text. While this does not meet standard contrast requirements, the button contains large text and is prominently sized. As it aligns with our established design patterns, we have decided to retain this styling.

### BUGS

Throughout the development process, I encountered numerous bugs in my code. While it would be difficult to detail all of them here, I will highlight a few notable examples.

- Reservation Form Validation: Prevented users from selecting a check-in date in the past or a check-out date earlier than the check-in.

- Tab Title Formatting: Standardized tab title structure across all pages by adding a missing " - " (dash and space).
About Page Layout: Corrected a custom CSS class error that caused the button to stick to the footer.

- Form Layout: Fixed a typo that caused the submit button to align left instead of remaining centered.
Responsive Navigation: Repaired a broken Bootstrap link that prevented the hamburger menu from functioning on smaller screens.

- My Booking View Layout: Fixed layout issues for small screens to ensure proper responsiveness.

- 404 Page Display: Resolved an issue that prevented the custom 404 page from displaying correctly.

- Review Template Image: Corrected the image source reference to use the appropriate variable in the review template.

  THERE ARE NO OTHER BUGS I AM AWARE OF
